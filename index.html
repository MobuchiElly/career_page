            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>My name is Eleazer Mibuchi Ugwu. I am most commonly known as Buchi in the business/professional world. I am a full stack devloper currently. Before venturing into software devlopment I was a Customer Support Personal/Telemarketer.<br>
            During my early years as a CSP I was always intrigued by the computer and gadgets. I wanted to know how they worked, why they crashed at some point. I actively onboarded clients on the company's application and had to figure out ways around certain bugs before the fix was implemnted by the tech department. this passion led me to asking questions and brought me to where I am today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let's talk abut my goals for the next two years. I have these split in two
            </p>
            <h5>Corporate Goals</h5>
            <p>
                Being somewhat of a newbie to software devlopment I tend to ask a lot of questions. Friends in similar field, mentors, documentations, AI assistants, Technical contents and even videos have been my friend but while i actively set plans and constantly improve my knowledge i know that working with a company has it's pecks. As such i have set out to work for a company whose goals align with mine. constantly learn new technologies, new languages, new ways of doing things and most importntly tackle new challenges. the joy that comes with seeing a challenge become water under the bridge is quite fulfilling. To achieve this, I have been constantly upskilling, acquiring certificates, taking interview preps and challenging myself with leetcode problems while i apply
            </p>
            <h5>Business Goals</h5>
            <p>
                My business goals are the gold mine in my mind. Years as a customer support officer enabled me see the needs of the customers as such I have been building solutions and applications to meet this need
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
                It is my believe that enrolling and participating in HNG's internship would be a fulfilling one as I would be chalenged constantly. I keenly antivipate the group projects, team bonding and sense of fulfilment that comes with delivering scalable and user intuitive solutions
            </p>
